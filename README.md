# Photo display
This is a program developed in C# Windows Form application mode. When it is loaded it displays the image "Logo01.jpg" which is in the folder "imagens" and when the button "exibir foto" is clicked it displays the image "Logo02.jpg".

The main file where the codes are is <b><i>MainForm.cs</i></b>

Here is a gif of how the application works:
